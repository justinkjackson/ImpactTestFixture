As a closing to the ECE curriculum, we are tasked with a Senior Capstone project that involves designing a product that is cutting edge that satisfies both Hardware and Software aspects of ECE. Impact Test Fixture is a fully integrated identification and testing system written in Python and housed on a Raspberry Pi 3. The system was designed for Milwaukee Tool which assisted production in identifying their impact wrenches using Character Recognition software(OCR and Tesseract) that correlated the values to torque specifications created by the company. This allows for a robust testing procedure with minimal room for error.
